#### Simulation of an Inverse Pendulum - A Segway
Completion of an Incomplete C++ code that simulates the behaviour of a self-regulating inverse pendulum - a segway.

The C++ code, upon execution, generates an output that is evaluated using the python script 'plot.py' that has already been provided. The output of this python script is a plot of entities over time. 

Code submitted to Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg as a part of the Programming Project in the course Introduction to Scientific Programming in Wintersemester 2019/20 as stipulated by the curriculum of Masters Course Computational Materials Science.
